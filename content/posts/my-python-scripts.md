I﻿ have added a new section in the site with some simple scripts built with Python. The UI uses [B﻿rython](https://brython.info/), a Python 3 implementation that allows you to run Python code in the browser.



I will use this section to experiment with Python and some web technologies. My main goal is to the write the scripts in Python and make them usable in the browser.

I﻿n the new [Projects](https://silvino.net/projects/) section you will find:

- a simple [calculator](https://silvino.net/projects/calculadora.html)

- a tool to convert between the various [MAC Addresses Formats](https://silvino.net/projects/mac.html)
- a simple [calendar](https://silvino.net/projects/calendar.html). Python modules: calendar and datetime.
- an [IP Subnet Calculator](https://silvino.net/projects/ip_calc/ip_calc.html). Python module: ipaddress.

If you have Python in your computer, you can run the IP Subnet Calculator in your OS by downloading the script [ip_calc.py](https://silvino.net/projects/ip_calc/ip_calc.py) to your machine. You can also clone the [ip_calc](https://github.com/tdmsilvino/ip_calc) reposity from my Github, and track the changes as I add more functionalities to the script.

I﻿ hope you enjoy!
